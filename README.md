# Front-End Integration

## Connecting to React

Since this course is on .NET Core and not React, this section is going to rely on your previous React experience and will not be going into detail about the steps. All necessary code will be here to test it out even without previous knowledge of React. If you plan on using Angular exclusively, skip to the next section.

### Create React App

1. Open the terminal, navigate to your course folder and then run the `create-react-app` command with the project name of `react-api-eater`.

```
cd desktop
cd Programming/CSharp
npx create-react-app react-api-eater
cd react-api-eater
code .
```

To run the app open the VS Code built-in terminal and enter `npm start`. The browser will greet you on the default home page.
